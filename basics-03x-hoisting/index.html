  <h2>Hoisting</h2>
  
  <p>In JavaScript, hoisting is a behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. 
    This means that variables and functions can be used before they are declared in the code.</p>

  <p>Here's a basic example to illustrate hoisting with a var variable:</p>

  <pre>
    console.log(b); // returns undefined
    var b = 20;
    console.log(b); // returns 20
  </pre>

  <p>In the example above, the JavaScript engine hoists the declaration var b; to the top of the scope, and initializes a variable with undefined.
    So, the first console.log outputs undefined because b is declared but not yet assigned a new value.</p>

  <p>For variables declared with let and const, hoisting behaves differently. While the declarations are still hoisted, they are not initialized with undefined, 
    and trying to access them before the declaration will result in a ReferenceError. This is sometimes referred to as the "temporal dead zone."</p>

  <pre>
    console.log(d); // throws ReferenceError: can't access lexical declaration 'd' before initialization
    let d = 40;
  </pre>

  <p>In this case, d is hoisted, but because it's declared with let, accessing it before the declaration results in an error.</p>

  <p>To avoid confusion and potential errors, it's a good practice to declare all variables at the beginning of their scope.</p>
