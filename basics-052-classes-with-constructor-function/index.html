In this example, Pen is a constructor function that has name, color, and price properties. We are using the new keyword with the Pen constructor to create an object pen1.

<code>
function Pen(name, color, price) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.price = price;
}
const pen1 = new Pen("Marker", "Blue", "$3");
</code>
