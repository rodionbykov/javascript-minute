  <p>In JavaScript, global scope is the widest scope available. Variables declared in global scope are accessible from anywhere in your code.</p>
  <p>Whether it's inside functions, conditional statements, loops, or other blocks of code, global variables are always visible.</p>

  </pre>

function myFunction() {
    carName = "Volvo"; // This implicitly declares a global variable
}

However, itâ€™s generally better to explicitly declare variables to avoid unexpected behavior1.
Remember that global scope provides broad accessibility, but itâ€™s essential to use it judiciously. Overusing global variables can lead to unintended side effects and make your code harder to maintain. Whenever possible, prefer local or block scope to encapsulate variables within specific contexts2. ðŸŒŸ
