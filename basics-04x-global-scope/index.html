  <p>In JavaScript, global scope is the widest scope available. Variables declared in global scope are accessible from anywhere in your code.</p>
  <p>Whether it's inside functions, conditional statements, loops, or other blocks of code, global variables are always visible.</p>

  <pre>
    const global_constant = "this is global";

    let global_variable = 42;

    function global_function(){
      console.log("I can see global variables");
    
      // everything declared outside function scope is visible inside a function
      console.log(global_constant);
      console.log(global_variable);
    }
  </pre>

  <p>Remember that global scope provides broad accessibility, and can lead to unintended side effects and make your code harder to maintain. 
    Whenever possible, prefer function or block scope to encapsulate variables within specific contexts.</p>
