In this example, Rectangle is a class and it has a constructor method. When a new object is created from this class (e.g., new Rectangle(10, 20)), the constructor is called with the given arguments.

<code>
  class Rectangle {
    constructor(height, width) {
      this.height = height;
      this.width = width;
    }
  }
</code>
